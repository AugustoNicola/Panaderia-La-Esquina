<br>

The online store is a Single Page Application (SPA) which consists of two parts: the **frontend**, made with React; and the **backend**, which uses Node.js + Express.js and connects to MongoDB database.

Some funcionalities in the project are: product listing with search queries and filers, account managing, buying carts and payment integration using paypal.

# Installation and Local Usage
In order to configure the development enviroment, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository and move to the target directory**
	
		$ git clone https://github.com/AugustoNicola/Panaderia-La-Esquina
		$ cd Panaderia-La-Esquina/

2. **Install the necessary dependencies**
		
		$ npm run install-all-dependencies

3. **Connect to the required services**  
	Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file holds the sensitive information needed for all services. Inside the file add the following fields:
	
		MONGODB_URL=your_own_mongodb_url
		SECRETO_TOKEN_ACCESO=your_own_access_secret
		SECRETO_TOKEN_REACCESO=your_own_relog_secret
	The `MONGODB_URL` field connects the app to your own cluster, whereas the `SECRETO`s *(secrets)* are used to verify user sessions, so any password will do (using a SHA256 hash is advised).

That's it, the project should be ready to boot!
